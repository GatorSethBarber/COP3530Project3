                    Exploring options is an important part of deciding which career to choose.
                    The Bureau of Labor Statistics puts out millions of data points a year on various occupations.
                    However, a major problem with this data is that it can be cumbersome and overwhelming for many users to search and analyze.
                    Our goal is to create a simplified search engine to help users parse through BLS data using just a few important data points.
                    Specifically, our search engine will allow users to search for careers based on average salaries,
                    projected job growth, education requirements, work experience needed, and more.

                    Our goal is to provide a method for non technically-inclied users to be able
                    to access unwiedly datasets to obtain necessary information pertinent to their career opportunities.
                    Additionally, we also seek to streamline the process in which users can find out an optimal
                    career path according to their preferences such as desired salary or level of education.
                    Lastly, it's important for us to be able to provide insights into the growth
                    of specific occupation paths to highly future opportunities.
